# Hi there 👋

I am interested in digital signal processing and enjoy making hardware or software related to audio. I use the Clang compiler, so you might encounter issues that are not supported by other compilers. I use KICAD, ARM-GCC, and RISCV-GCC, as well as CMake for building. I use C++20 and am not very familiar with various licenses, so please let me know promptly if there are any infringement issues. Thank you.

我使用C++20，不太熟悉各种许可证，如果有任何侵权问题，请及时提醒我，谢谢。
